<> is a variety of color change chrysoberyl. When viewed in daylight or fluorescent light alexandrites are green, turning red when viewed in incandescent light. Its strong color change properties, termed the 'alexandrite effect' result from minor chromium or vanadium impurities that replace aluminum in the crystal structure. Alexandrite are also strongly pleochroic and occasionally exhibit chatoyancy, in which-case they are cabbed into cat's eyes. Their rarity makes them very valuable,  often more then than sapphire, ruby and emerald when weighing over 1 carat. Alexandrite were first discovered in 1834 in Ural Mountains of Russia and was named after future Russian Tsar Alexander II. These mines dried up after a few decades but new deposits were found in Minas Gerais, Brazil in 1987. Today alexandrites are mined in Russia, Brazil, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and India.
